The hackathon was held by Russian development company Samolet.
The busieness problem that stands behind hack is optimization of tracking completeness of apartment block development. It was split into 2 stages and the teams had to solve 2 tasks.
- at the first we had to identify 3 stages of a window's completeness.
- at the second stages we additionally identified the floor and the "column" for each window. 
Thus, our team has developed multistage algorithm that stage of comleteness, floor and column for each single window.
