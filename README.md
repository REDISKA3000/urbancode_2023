The hackathon was held by Russian development company Samolet.
The busieness problem that stands behind hack is optimization of tracking completeness of apartment block development. It was split into 2 stages and the teams had to solve 2 tasks.
- at the first we had to identify 3 stages of a window's completeness.
- at the second stages we additionally identified the floor and the "column" for each window. <br/>

Thus, our team has developed multistage computer vision algorithm that identify stage of comleteness, floor and column for each single window.
